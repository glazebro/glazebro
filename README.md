- 👋 Hi, I’m @glazebro but my first name is Mike. I am currently working as a frontend developer with a focus on Angular.
- 👀 I’m interested in clean functional code and growing as a developer. I also want to build out my github portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular but anything and everything needed (c#, coffee.js, react, etc...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Angular projects, but honestly I mostly keep to myself at this point.
- 📫 How to reach me contact@mikeglazebrook.com
